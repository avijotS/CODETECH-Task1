### Overview:
- **Title:** To-Do List
- **Description:** This is a basic web application designed to help users manage their tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and remove tasks individually.

### Features:
- **Add Task:** Users can enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter to add it to the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, crossing out the text.
- **Remove Task:** Each task has a "Remove" button that allows users to delete the task from the list.

### Structure:
- **HTML Structure:** Defines the basic structure of the page, including an input field for tasks and a list (`ul`) to display tasks.
- **CSS Styling:** Provides styles for the layout, input fields, buttons, and task items. It includes a gradient background and a centered layout.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Manages the dynamic behavior of the application:
  - **addTask():** Creates a new task item when the user adds a task.
  - **removeTask(button):** Removes a task when the user clicks on the "Remove" button associated with that task.
  - **Event Listeners:** Listens for user interactions such as key presses and clicks to trigger appropriate actions.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the elements and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing dynamic behavior and interactivity.

### Next Steps:
- **Enhancements:** Consider adding features like task prioritization, due dates, or categories.
- **Refinement:** Improve user interface elements such as animations or visual feedback.
- **Deployment:** Host the application online to make it accessible from any device with an internet connection.

This project serves as a practical exercise in web development, focusing on basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks.
